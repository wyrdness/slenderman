## Overview

Slenderman is a fictional supernatural entity created on June 10, 2009, by Eric Knudsen (username "Victor Surge") for a Something Awful forum contest challenging users to create paranormal images. The character is depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless white face, wearing a black suit, with tentacle-like appendages extending from its back.

According to the fiction, Slenderman stalks, abducts, and traumatizes victims (especially children), causes "Slender sickness" (paranoia, nightmares, nosebleeds), and can teleport. Originally collaborative internet fiction (creepypasta), the character went viral through web series like *Marble Hornets* (2009), video games like *Slender: The Eight Pages* (2012), and widespread sharing across the internet.

**The phenomenon took a tragic turn in 2014** when two 12-year-old girls in Waukesha, Wisconsin stabbed a classmate 19 times, claiming they did it to please Slenderman and become his "proxies." The victim survived. This incident brought mainstream attention and highlighted the potential for fiction-to-belief transformation, especially in vulnerable individuals.

**Significance**: Slenderman represents **modern mythology creation**—a documented fictional entity that became embedded in cultural consciousness within years. It demonstrates how folklore operates in the digital age: collaborative creation, rapid viral spread, and in some cases, genuine belief despite known fictional origin.

## History: Creation to Phenomenon

### The Beginning: 2009

**June 10, 2009**: Eric Knudsen (username Victor Surge) posted two edited photographs to a Something Awful forum thread titled "Create Paranormal Images." The images showed groups of children with a tall, faceless figure lurking in the background, accompanied by fabricated "eyewitness" testimonies.

**Original caption excerpt**:
> *"We didn't want to go, we didn't want to kill them, but its persistent silence and outstretched arms horrified and comforted us at the same time..."* — 1983, photographer unknown, presumed dead

**Impact**: Almost immediately, other forum users began contributing their own Slenderman stories, images, and lore. A collaborative mythos was born.

3. **Lack of context**: Younger viewers may not have understood fictional origins
4. **Mental health vulnerabilities**: Individuals with certain conditions more susceptible
5. **Social reinforcement**: Online communities treating Slenderman as real
