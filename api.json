      "full": "Slenderman is a fictional supernatural entity created on June 10, 2009, by Eric Knudsen (username \\\"Victor Surge\\\") for a Something Awful forum contest challenging users to create paranormal images. The character is depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a blank, featureless white face, wearing a black suit, with tentacle-like appendages extending from its back. According to the fiction, Slenderman stalks, abducts, and traumatizes victims (especially children), causes \\\"Slender sickness\\\" (paranoia, nightmares, nosebleeds), and can teleport. Originally collaborative internet fiction (creepypasta), the character went viral through web series like *Marble Hornets* (2009), video games like *Slender: The Eight Pages* (2012), and widespread sharing across the internet."
