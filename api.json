      "full": "Slenderman is a fictional supernatural entity created on June 10, 2009, by Eric Knudsen (username Victor Surge) for a Something Awful forum 'create paranormal images' contest. Depicted as an unnaturally tall, thin figure with a featureless white face, wearing a black suit, with tentacle-like appendages extending from its back. The character stalks, abducts, and traumatizes victims (especially children), causes 'Slender sickness' (paranoia, nightmares), and can teleport. Originally collaborative internet fiction (creepypasta), Slenderman went viral through web series like Marble Hornets, video games (Slender: The Eight Pages), and widespread sharing. The phenomenon took a tragic turn in 2014 when two 12-year-old girls in Wisconsin stabbed a classmate 19 times, claiming they did it to please Slenderman. This incident highlighted the potential for fiction-to-belief transformation. Slenderman represents modern mythology creation: a documented fictional entity that became embedded in cultural consciousness, with some individuals (especially youth) developing genuine belief. Related to other internet folklore like The Rake and Black-eyed Children."
